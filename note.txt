1) A closer look at JSX
In JSX, we can write code just like HTML tags but it's not a real HTML tags, it's just help we easily to return what we want to display 
	in the component.
In the older versions of React we have to import lib React from 'react' in every single component (we can search some project to watch 
	how to return a JSX in older way).
When we return what we want to display in our components, we have to make sure that there is only an element (we can return an array of elements)
	but we cannot return more than one element that is the reason why we should use a div tag to wrapper what we return.
